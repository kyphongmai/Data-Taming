# Data-Taming
R skills demonstrated through Data Taming MATHS7107 Assignment, covering data import, tidying, transformation, visualisation, and modelling using tidyverse and tidymodels.

## Assignment 2
***Dataset***: 2019 Ashes men's criket series between Australia and England ("ashes.csv")

***Tasks***:

- Data cleaning
- Univariate analysis

 
## Assignment 3
***Dataset***: Newspaper circulation and number of Pulitzer Prizes in a 25 year period ("pulitzer.csv")

***Goals***: Build linear regression models to predict newspaper's circulation to strategically determine the newspaper's direction: whether to focus on investigative articles or shift to a more populist, tabloid slant.

***Tasks***:

- Data cleaning
- Univariate analysis and transformation
- Model building and interpretation
- Prediction
- Model limitations
- Report writing

 
## Assignment 4
***Dataset***: Melbourne's weather observations ("melbourne.csv")

***Goals***: Build a model to predict evaporation, to ensure stability of water supply.

***Tasks***:

- Bivariate summaries
- Model selection
- Model interpretation
- Model diagnostics (assumption checking)
- Prediction

 
## Assignment 5
***Dataset***: Extramarital activites of readers of Psychology Today in 1969 ("affairs.csv")

***Goals***: Build a predictive model (k-nearest neighbours) to determine whether an individual is likely to engage in extramarital affairs based on various aspects of their lives.

***Tasks***:

- Data cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis
- Data preprocessing
- Model building and hyperparameter tuning
- Model evaluation
- Prediction
